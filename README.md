# SeleniumExamples
examples of end to end testing using selenium webdriver. This shows how to use Page Objects to encapsulate connected steps and reduce
length of your test scripts to plainly describe interactions with an app. Sample tests demonstrates an approach to managing test suites
and executing a singly defined test with multiple times with different browsers or other parameters.

SET UP:
install dependencies using maven. Our only dependency is selenium.
mvn clean install

To run tests you will also need to download the browser drivers (chromedriver.exe, geckodriver.exe, etc) and update the path to the driver in the sampleTest. 
(todo: this configuration should be moved)

EXECUTING TESTS:
mvn test

OR click run from your IDE.
